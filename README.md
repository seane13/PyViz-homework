## San Francisco Neighborhood Data Analysis 

This project analyzed the sales and rental data from San Francisco neighborhoods from 2010 to 2016. The project includes charts and plots from Pandas, Matplotlib, and Hvplot as well as a Panel dashboard for ease of use. Detailed in this analysis includes number of housing units, sales price per square foot, gross rent, and top ten most expensive neighborhoods per year.  


This project provided many challenges for me to overcome and a few to be solved still. As of now this is a work in progress. The ylim adjusted chart does not show in dashboard. Also the Neighborhood Analysis shows outside of my tabs instead of inside. Please navigate the other charts through the tabs on the dashboard page. Many of the charts are interactive to provide additional information.
